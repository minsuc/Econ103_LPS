\begin{questions}

\question Indicate whether each of the following statements is True or False. If False, provide a one sentence explanation. If True, no explanation is needed.
\begin{parts}
  \part The sample covariance between $x$ and \emph{itself} equals the sample variance of $x$.
  \begin{solution}[1.5in]
    True.
  \end{solution}
  \part The sample variance of the z-scores always equals zero.
  \begin{solution}[1.5in]
    False: it equals one. It is the sample \emph{mean} of the z-scores that equals zero.
  \end{solution}
  \part If a variable has a positive skewness, then we would generally expect its mean to be \textit{less than} its median.
  \begin{solution}[1.5in]
    False: we would expect the mean to be greater than the median, as the mean is influenced by outliers in the (positive) tail.
  \end{solution}
  \part In a large population that is approximately bell-shaped, roughly 68\% of the z-scores will be between -2 and 2.
  \begin{solution}[1.5in]
    False: roughly 95\% will be between -2 and 2, while roughly 68\% will be between -1 and 1.
  \end{solution}

\newpage

  \part For any events $A$ and $B$, $P(A\cap B) = P(B\cap A)$.
  \begin{solution}[1.5in]
    True
  \end{solution}
  \part For any events $A$ and $B$, $P(B) = P(A\cap B)/P(B|A)$
  \begin{solution}[1.5in]
    False: this gives $P(A)$ rather than $P(B)$. To correct the equality, replace $P(B|A)$ by $P(A|B)$.
  \end{solution}
% % % % % %

  \part A random variable is neither random, nor a variable.
  \begin{solution}[1.5in]
    True
  \end{solution}
  \part The expected value of a Bernoulli$(p)$ random variable equals $1/2$.
  \begin{solution}[1.5in]
    False: it equals $p$.
  \end{solution}
  \part If $X\sim \mbox{Bernoulli}(p)$ then $E[X^2] = p$.
  \begin{solution}[1.5in]
    True
  \end{solution}
  \part If $X$ is a discrete RV with pmf $p(x)$, then $\displaystyle\sum_{\text{all } x} x p(x) = 1$.
  \begin{solution}[1.5in]
    False: this expression gives the \emph{expected value} of $X$ which need not be one. The correct statement is $\displaystyle\sum_{\text{all } x} p(x) = 1$.
  \end{solution}
\end{parts}


\question Five friends want to lose weight so they sign up for a five-week program of fitness classes.
At the end of the program, they note down how many weeks of classes they each attended, $x$, and the change in their weight in kilograms, $y$. 
The data appear in the table below. 
Since $y$ denotes a \emph{change} in weight, $y_i=-1$ means that person $i$ lost one kilogram.
\textit{\paragraph{Note:} If you get an early part to this question incorrect and have to use the results of this part later on, we will take account of this in grading and assign partial credit accordingly.
We have left space in the table for your calculations.}

\begin{parts}
	\part Calculate $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{y}$.
  \begin{solution}[1in]
    $\bar{x} = (3+3+4+5+5)/5 = 4$, $\bar{y} = (0 - 1 + 0 -2 -2)/5 =  -1$ 
	\end{solution}
	
	\part Calculate the sample variances, $s^2_{x}$ and $s^2_{y}$.
  \begin{solution}[1.2in]
		For parts (b) and (c) it is useful to fill in the table as follows:
		\begin{center}
			\begin{tabular}
				{r|r|r}
				 $x_i - \bar{x}$ & $y_i - \bar{y}$ & $(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})$\\
				 \hline
				 -1 & 1 & -1 \\
				 -1 & 0 & 0 \\
				 0 & 1 & 0 \\
				 1 & -1 & -1 \\
				 1 & -1 & -1
			\end{tabular}
		\end{center}		
		We have $s_x^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2$ and $s_y^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2$
		\begin{align*}
		s_x^2 = (1/4)(1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1) = 1\\
		s_y^2 = (1/4)(1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 1
		\end{align*} 
	\end{solution}
	
	\part Calculate the sample covariance between $x$ and $y$.
  \begin{solution}[2in]
   Using the values from the table in solution to (b), 
   \begin{align*}
   s_{xy} & = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})
   \\ & = (1/4)(-1 + 0 + 0 - 1 - 1) = -3/4

\question Use what you know about summation notation to prove the following equality:
  $$\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y}) = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i\right) - n\bar{x}\bar{y} $$ 
  \begin{solution}[2in]
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x}) (y_i - \bar{y}) &=& \sum_{i=1^n}x_i y_i - \bar{x}\sum_{i=1}^n y_i - \bar{y} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \sum_{i=1}^n\bar{x}\bar{y}\\
      &=& \sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i - \bar{x}(n\bar{y}) - \bar{y} (n\bar{x}) + n\bar{x}\bar{y}\\
  &=& \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i\right) - n\bar{x}\bar{y}
    \end{eqnarray*}
  \end{solution}
  %\part[5] Use the equality you proved in the preceding part to show that:
  %$$\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\right) -n\bar{x}^2$$

\question Suppose I flip a fair coin and roll a single fair die at the same time. Define the events 
\\ $A =$ the coin comes up tails 
\\ $B =$ the die shows a 3 \emph{or} 5
\\ $C =$ the die shows an \emph{odd} number 
 	\begin{parts} 
    \part Calculate $P(B|C)$.
    \begin{solution}[1.25in]
      \[P(B|C) = P(B\cap C)/P(C) =  (1/3)/(1/2) = 2/3\] 
    \end{solution}
    \part Calculate $P(A \cap B)$.
    \begin{solution}[1.25in]
      Since the dice roll and coin flip are independent, we have $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B) = (1/2) \times (1/3) = 1/6$. You could also draw out the table with all 12 basic outcomes, all of which are equally likely, and count how many are in both $A$ and $B$. This will give you $2/12 = 1/6$
    \end{solution}
    
    \part Calculate $P(A \cup B)$.
    \begin{solution}[1.25in]
      $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) = 1/2 + 1/3 -1/6 = 3/6 + 2/6 - 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3$.  Again, you could also draw out the table with all 12 basic outcomes, all of which are equally likely, and count how many are in either $A$, $B$ or both $A$ and $B$. This will give you $8/12 = 2/3$
    \end{solution}

\question This question asks you to prove some results about probability that we did not cover in class.
Let $A$, $B$ and $C$ be three arbitrary events.
\begin{parts}
  \part Prove \emph{Boole's Inequality}: $P(A\cup B) \leq P(A) + P(B)$. 
  \begin{solution}[2.4in]
   By the Addition Rule $P(A\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cap B)$. The result follows since $P(A\cap B) \geq 0$ by the first axiom of probability. 
  \end{solution}

  \part Prove \emph{Bonferroni's Inequality}: $P(A\cap B) \geq P(A) + P(B) - 1$.
  \begin{solution}[2.4in]
   Rearranging the Addition Rule, $P(A\cap B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A\cup B)$. The result follows since $P(A\cup B)$ is at most one by the first axiom of probability.
  \end{solution}
\end{parts}

  \question New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady has a lucky coin, which he flips five times before every game.
  The coin is fair, so it has a probability 1/2 of coming up heads on any given flip.
  \begin{parts}
    \part What is the probability that Tom gets the same outcome for all 5 flips of his lucky coin? Express your answer as a fraction.
    \begin{solution}[2.5in]
      There are two possibilities here: Tom can either get 5 heads, or he can get 5 tails. Both have the same probability, $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5$. As they are mutually exclusive, we can add the probability of each possibility to get:
      $$Pr(5H \cup 5T) = P(5H) + P(5T) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^5 = \frac{1}{32} + \frac{1}{32} = \frac{1}{16}$$
    \end{solution}
    % % %
    \part Tom is a superstitious person.
    If (and only if) he gets 5 heads or 5 tails he will cheat by deflating the balls used in the game. If Tom cheats, the Patriots win with probability $\frac{3}{4}$. But if Tom does not cheat, they win with probability $\frac{2}{5}$. Given that the Patriots won the game, what is the probability that Tom cheated?
    \begin{solution}[4in]
      First write down all the probabilities given in the question statement.
      Let $C$ be the event that Tom Brady cheats $C$ and $W$ be the event that the Patriots win. 
      (Using this notation $C^c$ is the event that Tom \emph{doesn't} cheat.)
     From Part (c), we know that $P(C) = 1/16$  and therefore $P(C^c) = 1 - P(C) = 15/16$. We are told in the problem statment that $P(W|C) = 3/4$ while $P(W|C^c) = 2/5$ and are asked to find $P(C|W)$. By Bayes' Rule:
    \begin{equation*}
      P(\mbox{C}|\mbox{W}) = \frac{P(\mbox{C})P(\mbox{W}|\mbox{C})}{P(\mbox{W})}
    \end{equation*}
    To calculate the denominator, we use the law of total probability:
    \begin{eqnarray*}
      P(\mbox{W}) &=& P(\mbox{W}|\mbox{C})P(\mbox{C})+ P(\mbox{W}|\mbox{$C^c$})P(\mbox{$C^c$})\\
      &=& 3/4 \times 1/16 + 2/5 \times 15/16 \\
      &=& 3/64 + 3/8 = 3/64 + 24/64 = 27/64
    \end{eqnarray*}
    Now putting all of these pieces together, we get:
    \begin{equation*}
          P(\mbox{C}|\mbox{W}) = \frac{P(\mbox{C})P(\mbox{W}|\mbox{C})}{P(\mbox{W})} = \frac{3/64}{27/64} = \frac{3}{27} = \frac{1}{9}
        \end{equation*}
    \end{solution}
  \end{parts}

\question This question asks you for the R commands needed to carry out tasks similar to those in the tutorials. 
The first two parts refer to the dataframe \texttt{jobsearch} that we created in R Tutorial 1.
The entire dataframe is printed below.
  \begin{verbatim}
  ##   location salary              title hours
  ## 1 New York  70000     Office Manager    50
  ## 2  Chicago  80000 Research Assistant    56
  ## 3   Boston  60000            Analyst    65
  ## 4   Boston  50000     Office Manager    40
  ## 5 New York  45000            Analyst    50
  \end{verbatim}
 
\begin{parts}
% % % % % %
  \part  
 Create a new dataframe called `highpay' by taking a subset of the `jobsearch' dataframe to include only jobs which pay more than \$55,000.
  \begin{solution}[1.5in]
    \texttt{highpay <- subset(jobsearch, salary > 55000)}
  \end{solution}

  
  \part  Write code to calculate the number of observations in your new dataframe, \texttt{highpay}, and call this number \texttt{n}.
    \begin{solution}[1.5in]
    To do this, you must calculate the length of one of the columns in the dataframe, as \texttt{length(highpay)} gives the number of variables. For example:
    \\ \texttt{n <- length(highpay\$salary)}
    \end{solution}
% % % % % %

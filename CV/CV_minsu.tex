  & \textbf{``Does Heterogeneity Matter for Aggregate Fluctuations?"}\\
  & (with Xiaohong Chen and Frank Schorfheide)\\[0.05in] 
  & We specify a vector autoregressive model that stacks macroeconomic aggregates\\
 & and cross-sectional distributions to provide semi-structural evidence about the \\
 & interaction of aggregate and distributional dynamics. The specification of our\\
 & functional VAR is motivated by a linearization of a reduced-form model where\\
 & dynamics of aggregates and a function of lagged cross-sectional distribution of\\ & individual-level decisions or states, and the units (households or firms) base their\\ & decisions on lagged macroeconomic aggregates and cross-sectional distributions.\\ & To make the functional VAR analysis tractable, we approximate the log-densities\\ & of the cross-sectional distributions as well as the transition kernels in the functional\\ 
 & VARs by sieves. We apply our techniques to study the dynamics of technology\\ & shocks, per capita GDP, employment, and the earnings distribution.\\[0.1in]

 & \textbf{``Feasible Multivariate Density Estimation"} (with Paul Sangrey)\\[0.05in]
 & The curse of dimensionality makes multivariate nonparametric density estimation\\
 & infeasible with more than a few series. We provide Bayesian nonparametric density\\
 & estimators whose complexity is independent of the number of series by exploiting\\
 & the concentration of probability measures in high dimensions. We study Gaussian\\
 & hidden Markov processes providing a mixture representation where the number of\\
 & components grows logarithmically with the time dimension $T$. Our marginal density\\
 &estimator contracts at a rate $\sqrt{\log(T)}/\sqrt{T}$, and our transition density estimator\\
 & contracts at a rate $\log(T)/\sqrt{T}$. We provide a computationally efficient Bayesian\\
 & estimator using Dirichlet processes and apply it to two empirical examples.\\[0.1in]

 \large{\textbf{Work}}  & \textbf{``Estimating Heterogeneous Agent Models:
A Likelihood Approach}\\
 \large{\textbf{in progress}}& \textbf{with Particle Filter"}\\[0.05in]
& Heterogeneous agent macroeconomic models have mostly relied on calibration,\\
&which cannot make testable statements regarding
parameter uncertainty and its \\
&statistical significance. This paper suggests how to estimate a
heterogeneous agent\\
& model similar to Krusell and Smith (1998) with Bayesian
particle filtering.\\

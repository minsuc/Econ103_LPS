\begin{block}{P-value measures strength of evidence against $H_0$}
Lower p-value means stronger evidence. 
\end{block}

\begin{block}{(Two-sided p-value) $= 2 \; \times$  (one-sided p-value)}
Reject $H_0$ based on two-sided test $\implies$ Reject $H_0$ based on appropriate one-sided test. The converse is \emph{false}.

\frametitle{Steps in Hypothesis Testing}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Specify Null and Alternative Hypotheses
\item Identify a Test Statistic: a function of the data that has a known sampling distribution under the null.
\item Specify a Decision Rule and a Critical Value so the Type I Error Rate equals $\alpha$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{alertblock}{Alternative to Step 3}
	Calculate P-Value: the minimum significance level  ($\alpha$) at which we would reject $H_0$ given the observed data.

\frametitle{How to Handle Other Examples?}

\alert{You already know lots of sampling distributions! Testing is very similar to constructing confidence intervals in that the steps are always the same, and the only thing that differs is \emph{which} sampling distribution we work with. We'll look at more examples next time.}

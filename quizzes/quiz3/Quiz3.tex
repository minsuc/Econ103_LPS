%This is a convenience command for conditional compilation that controls which questions are shown to a particular recitation section on the quiz. Any question not enclosed by \showto is shown to all recitation sections. The first argument to \showto is the desired section number. The second argument is the question body

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Question 3
\showto{201}{\question (1 point)  A continuous random variable $X$ has a probability density function $f(x)$. It is possible that for some value we have $f(x)>1$. True or false?\vspace{0.2in} \answerline[True]}


\showto{201}{\question (1 point) A continuous random variable $X$ has a probability density function $f(x)$. We interpret $f(3)$ as the probability that the random variable takes the value of 3. True or false? \vspace{0.2in} \answerline[False]}

\showto{205}{\question  A continuous random variable $X$ has a probability density function $f(x)$. It is possible that for some value $f(x)<0$ for some $x$. True or false? \answerline[False]}

\showto{201}{\question (2 points) The random variable $X$ follows a Uniform(0,1) distribution. Write down its CDF, $F(x_0)$. (Hint - make sure you consider all possible cases for $x_0$) \vspace{1.0in}\answerline []}
